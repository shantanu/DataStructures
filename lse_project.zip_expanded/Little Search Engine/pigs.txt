Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who went off to build their houses.

The first little pig built his house of straw, which was not very strong.

One day, the big bad wolf came and said, ¡°Little pig, little pig, let me come in.¡±

¡°Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin,¡± said the first little pig.

¡°Then I¡¯ll huff and I¡¯ll puff, and I¡¯ll blow your house down.¡±

And he did. And he got the little pig and ate him all up.

The second little pig built his house of sticks, which were not very strong.

One day, the big bad wolf came and said, ¡°Little pig, little pig, let me come in.¡±

¡°Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin,¡± said the second little pig.

¡°Then I¡¯ll huff and I¡¯ll puff and I¡¯ll blow your house down.¡±

And he did. And he got the little pig and ate him all up.

The third little pig built his house of bricks, which were very strong.

One day, the big bad wolf came and said, ¡°Little pig, little pig, let me come in.¡±

¡°Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin,¡± said the third little pig.

¡°Then I¡¯ll huff and I¡¯ll puff and I¡¯ll blow your house down.¡±

But no matter how much the wolf huffed and puffed, the house did not blow down.

So the big bad wolf said, ¡°I¡¯ll come down the chimney and eat you all up.¡±

But when the wolf came down the chimney, he fell into a pot of boiling water and boiled all up.

And the third little pig lived happily ever after in his house of bricks.
